Introduction

This script provides a workout plan based on user's specifications, such as plan type (day or week), days per week, body part, fitness level, and plan option. The workout plan is generated using the megaGymDataset.csv file, which contains information about various exercises for different body parts. The pandas library is used to read the dataset and generate a workout plan. The randint function from the random module is used to randomly select exercises from the dataset. A website is deployed using flask where users can input parameters that will be used in the code. This creates a realistic environment for which our code is purposed for.

Requirements:

pandas library
random module

Usage

When you visit the website, you will be prompted to input the parameters required by the code. These parameters will be used to generate the desired results.

The website is run through an web appliation called Python Anywhere by Anaconda. For anyone with the files trying to run the code they can go to their website and create an account. please upload all the files in order for the website to be generated properly. The link for a working website is posted above in this file.
